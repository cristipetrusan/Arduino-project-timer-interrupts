## Arduino-project-timer-interrupts
In this project, I had the opportunity to work with ATMega328p Timers, Interrupt Service Routine (ISR), Analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The challenge was not to use libraries or already defined functions.

#### The project contains:
- 1 Arduino UNO
- 4 LED
- 1 7-Segment-Display
- 1 motherboard
- 1 potentiometer (instead of a temperature sensor, for example: TMP36)
- resistors
- jumper wires
